# R Matrix Operations and Data Visualization

## Overview
This project demonstrates matrix operations and data visualization using R, focusing on ranking analysis and part-to-whole relationships. The visualizations were generated using the Plotly and Tidyverse packages, producing interactive HTML outputs.

## Objectives
1. Perform matrix operations, including calculating the inverse and determinant.
2. Visualize ranking data and part-to-whole relationships.
3. Generate HTML outputs for easy sharing and presentation.

## Approach
1. **Matrix Operations:** Created two matricesâ€”Matrix A (10x10) and Matrix B (10x100). Calculated the inverse and determinant of Matrix A while documenting the expected failure when attempting to determine Matrix B's determinant due to non-square structure.

2. **Data Visualization:** Utilized Plotly to create two interactive visualizations:
   - **Ranking Visualization:** Displays ranked positions with corresponding values over time.
   - **Part-to-Whole Visualization:** Highlights how individual parts contribute to the overall dataset.

## Results
The generated visualizations effectively demonstrate the intended matrix operations and data relationships. The R code ensures error handling, package verification, and compatibility with the latest R version (4.4.2).

## Visualizations

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of R for both matrix operations and interactive data visualization. By combining analytical and graphical approaches, it delivers clear insights into complex datasets.
